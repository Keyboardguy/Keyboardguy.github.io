Anything prefixed with 'calculation' in the calculation.js file classes means
the balancing angle has been acounted for. That is, that the applied force
has been rotated to be 0deg relative to the clockwise vertical, thereby
turning essentailly the entire bridge around it.

The force will always be the same no matter what angle - but the horizontal and vertical forces
will be different. That's why calculation_force isn't a thing.

Generally, you never want to use anything except the calculation properties for actually
doing the calcuations.
